        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An easy, delicious, egg and lunch meat based sandwich recipe</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tall burger bun</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 slices mortadella, sliced ¼ inch thick</li>
            <li>1 slice american cheese *note you can just pick one cheese or do both</li>
            <li>1 slice provolone *note you can just pick one cheese or do both</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Softened unsalted butter for cooking</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by preparing the bun by cutting it in half and trimming the domed part of the top bun so that it is the same height as the bottom bun.</li>
            <li>Prepare the eggs by whisking together until homogenous, then seasoning with salt.</li>
            <li>Heat a medium saute pan over medium heat. Once hot add mortadella to the pan. Sear each side for about 1-2 minutes. Repeat this step for all mortadella.</li>
            <li>Once the mortadella has been cooked, add the eggs to the pan, stirring to break up the curd that is forming.</li>
            <li>Once the egg is beginning to set, add a slice of provolone into the middle of the cheese. Then fold in the sides to create a square pocket that the provolone is in.</li>
            <li>Once the egg is cooked, begin to toast buttered buns in the pan.</li>
            <li>When the top bun is toasted, flip it over and begin to assemble the sandwich in the pan by placing a slice of american cheese onto the bun.</li>
            <li>Top the american cheese with the egg, then add the mortadella over the egg.</li>
            <li>Finish by adding the top and allow the sandwich to cook in the pan for 1 additional minute.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
